##### Abstract

The reintegration of former fighters is a cornerstone of peacebuilding, yet it often meets resistance in war-affected communities. This article presents findings from a conjoint experiment conducted in Nigeria to explore what drives citizens’ attitudes toward reintegration. Results show that remorse, family ties, and community safety provisions strongly shape support for reintegration. These insights help policymakers design reintegration programs that are both effective and socially legitimate.
