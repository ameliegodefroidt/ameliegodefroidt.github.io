##### Abstract

How does terrorism affect citizens’ political attitudes? While scholars often assume powerful and lasting effects, individual studies have produced mixed findings. This article synthesizes the available evidence through a three-level meta-analysis. Results show that terrorism has consistent but modest effects on public opinion: it increases perceptions of threat and reduces social trust, but has limited or no effects on core political values. The findings challenge alarmist narratives and highlight the need for nuanced theorizing about when, how, and for whom terrorism matters.
