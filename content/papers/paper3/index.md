##### Abstract

Can citizens accept peace provisions after violent conflict? This article examines how intergroup bias shapes support for compromise in post-war Azerbaijan. Findings indicate that strong biases against outgroups significantly reduce acceptance of provisions related to territory, governance, and security. The study highlights the obstacles that psychological dynamics pose for sustainable peace and the importance of targeted reconciliation efforts.
